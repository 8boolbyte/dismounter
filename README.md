## Introduction

The original Dismounter addon has not been updated in two years, therefore I forked the repository and updated to TOC to the TBC classic client, since version 2.2.4 Wrath Classic should also work. I will try and keep this updated, you're welcome to help! 

## About

Dismounter TBC (and Wrath) is a simple addon that will automatically dismounts you when you perform an action that needs you to be dismounted. It will also remove ghost wolf when an error occurs and while you're not in combat. This version is designed to work with World of Warcraft TBC Classic and since version 2.2.4 also for Wrath classic, for the version that works with World of Warcraft classic, follow the link at the start of this description.

## How it works

When you cast an action that requires you to dismount the addon will automatically dismount you. In the case that this action is a spell cast, you'll have to cast the spell again after automatically being dismounted. 

Dismounter TBC (and Wrath) will dismount you in the following scenarios:

- Attacking while mounting (auto attack, melee spell, caster spell);

- Casting a spell such as Stealth;

- Picking herbs or ores;

- Talking to the flight master;

- Crafting a profession item. 

It will also remove ghost wolf form when on error and not while in combat.
